        <h1>Wheat</h1>
        Bread and durum wheat (Triticum aestivum and T. turgidum) were domesticated in the Near and Middle East. Present world production is about 582.7 million tons from 213.8 million ha.(FAOSTAT, 2001).

The crop is grown as a rainfed crop in the temperate climates, in the sub-tropics with winter rainfall, in the tropics near the equator, in the highlands with altitudes of more than 1500 m and in the tropics away from the equator where the rainy season is long and where the crop is grown as a winter crop.

Wheat is grown under irrigation in the tropics either in the highlands near the equator and in the lowlands away from the equator. In the subtropics with summer rainfall the crop is grown under irrigation in the winter months. In the subtropics with winter rainfall it is grown under supplemental irrigation.

The length of the total growing period of spring wheat ranges from 100 to 130 days while winter wheat needs about 180 to 250 days to mature. Daylength and temperature requirements are key factors in variety selection. Varieties can be grouped as winter or spring types according to chilling requirements, winter hardiness and daylength sensitivity. Winter wheat requires a cold period or chilling (vernalization) during early growth for normal heading under long days. Winter wheat in its early stages of development exhibits a strong resistance to frost, down to - 20°C. The resistance is lost in the active growth period in spring and during head development and flowering periods frost may lead to head sterility. Because of this sometimes more damage is done to the winter crop by spring frost than by winter frost.

In areas of severe winters, cold winds and little snow, spring wheat varieties are grown. Spring wheat does not require chilling for heading and it is day-neutral. However, it is also sensitive to frost. For winter and spring wheat minimum daily temperature for measurable growth is about 5°C. Mean daily temperature for optimum growth and tillering is between 15 and 20°C. Occurrence of (spring) frost is an important factor in selection of sowing date. A dry, warm ripening period of 18°C or more is preferred. Mean daily temperatures of less than 10 to 12°C during the growing season make wheat a hazardous crop. Knowledge of genetic characteristics and particularly the growth and development pattern of wheat varieties is essential for meeting the combination of various climatic requirements for growth development and yield formation.

The crop can be grown on a wide range of soils but medium textures are preferred. Peaty soils containing high sodium, magnesium or iron should be avoided. The optimum pH ranges from 6 to 8. For good yields the fertilizer requirements are up to 150 kg/ha N, 35 to 45 kg/ha P and 25 to 50 kg/ha K.


Water Requirements:
For high yields water requirements (ETm) are 450 to 650 mm depending on climate and length of growing period. The crop coefficient (kc) relating maximum evapotranspiration (ETm) to reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is: during the initial stage 0.3-0.4 (15 to 20 days), the development stage 0.7-0.8 (25 to 30 days), the mid-season stage 1.05-1.2 (50 to 65 days), the late-season stage 0.65-0.7 (30 to 40 days) and at harvest 0.2-0.25.

Yield:
Under irrigation a good commercial grain yield is 6 to 9 ton/ha (10 to 13 percent moisture). The water utilization efficiency for harvested yield (Ey) for grain varies then between 0.8 and 1.6 kg/m3.
