                Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) is grown for fibre and seed. Present world production is about 21 million tons lint and 59.7 million tons seed cotton from about 33.98 million ha. (FAOSTAT, 2001). The origin of cotton is still uncertain. The development of the crop is sensitive to temperature. Cool nights and low daytime temperatures result in vegetative growth with few fruiting branches. The crop is very sensitive to frost and a minimum of 200 frost-free days is required. The length of the total growing period is about 150 to 180 days. Depending on temperature and variety, 50 to 85 days are required from planting to first bud formation, 25 to 30 days for flower formation and 50 to 60 days from flower opening to mature boll. No clear distinction can be made in crop growth periods since vegetative growth is continued during flowering and boll formation and flowering is continued during boll formation.

Cotton is a short-day plant but day-neutral varieties exist. However, the effect of daylength on flowering is influenced by temperature. Germination is optimum at temperatures of 18 to 30°C, with minimum of 14°C and maximum of 40°C. Delayed germination exposes seeds to fungus infections in the soil. For early vegetative growth, temperature must exceed 20°C with 30°C as desirable. For proper bud formation and flowering, daytime temperature should be higher than 20°C and night temperature higher than 12°C, but should not exceed 40 and 27°C respectively. Temperatures between 27 and 32°C are optimum for boll development and maturation but above 38°C yields are reduced.

Strong and/or cold winds seriously affect the delicate young seedlings and at maturity will blow away fibre from opened bolls and cause soiling of the fibre with dust.

Cotton is extensively grown under rainfed conditions. Although the crop is relatively resistant to short periods of waterlogging, heavy rainfall, however, can cause lodging. Continuous rain during flowering and boll opening will impair pollination and reduce fibre quality. Heavy rainfall during flowering causes flower buds and young bolls to fall.

Cotton is grown on a wide range of soils but medium and heavy textured, deep soils with good water holding characteristics are preferred. Acid or dense subsoils limit root penetration. The pH range is 5.5 to 8 with 7 to 8 regarded as optimum. The fertilizer requirements of cotton under irrigation are 100 to 180 kg/ha N, 20 to 60 kg/ha P and 50 to 80 kg/ha K. Two-thirds of the nutrients are taken up during the first 60 days of the growing period. Nitrogen should be readily available at the start of -the growing season; normally two applications are given with one after sowing and the other prior to flowering. Phosphate is applied before sowing. Plant spacing normally varies between 50/100 x 30/50 cm.

Water Requirements:
Depending on climate and length of the total growing period, cotton needs some 700 to 1300 mm to meet its water requirements (ETm). In the early vegetative period, crop water requirements are low, or some 10 percent of total. They are high during the flowering period when leaf area is at its maximum, or some 50 to 60 percent of total. Later in the growing period the requirements decline. In relation to reference evapotranspiration (ETo) the crop coefficient (kc) for the different development stages is: for the initial stage 0.4-0.5 (20 to 30 days), the development stage 0.7-0.8 (40 to 50 days), the mid-season stage 1.05-1.25 (50 to 60 days), the late-season stage 0.8-0.9 (40 to 55 days), and at harvest 0.65-0. 7.

Yield:
A good yield of a 160 to 180 day cotton crop under irrigation is 4 to 5 ton/ha seed cotton of which 35 percent is lint. Water utilization efficiency for harvested yield (Ey) for seed cotton containing about 10 percent moisture is 0.4 to 0.6 kg/m3. Boll and fibre properties such as lint to seed ratio, and length, strength and fineness of lint, are primarily determined by the variety and to a lesser extent by irrigation and fertilizer practices. In general, the boll size, and the seed and lint index (weight per 100 seeds) increases under adequate water supply. However, the lint percentage (the ratio lint to seed) tends to decrease. Low soil water depletion levels during yield formation (3) tend to result in longer and finer fibre of decreased strength. The direct effect of water deficits on fibre properties, however, appears to be small because of the shedding of bolls which would have produced inferior fibre when allowed to mature.

Normally cotton seed contains 35 percent oil and 35 percent protein. Under irrigation there is an indication that severe water deficits substantially reduce the oil percentage in the seed, and more fibrous material with 20 percent lower oil and protein content is produced compared to an adequately irrigated crop.
