                Crop Description and Climate:
                The present area of sugarcane (Saccarum officinarum) is about 13 million ha with a total commercial world production of about 1254.8 million ton/year cane or 55 million ton/year sucrose. (FAOSTAT, 2001).
                Sugarcane originated in Asia, probably in New Guinea. Most of the rainfed and irrigated commercial sugarcane is grown between 35°N and S of the equator. The crop flourishes under a long, warm growing season with a high incidence of radiation and adequate moisture, followed by a dry, sunny and fairly cool but frost-free ripening and harvesting period.

                Optimum temperature for sprouting (germination) of stem cuttings is 32 to 38°C. Optimum growth is achieved with mean daily temperatures between 22 and 30°C. Minimum temperature for active growth is approximately 20°C. For ripening, however, relatively lower temperatures in the range of 20 to 10°C are desirable, since this has a noticeable influence on the reduction of vegetative growth rate and the enrichment of sucrose in the cane.

                A long growing season is essential for high yields. The normal length of the total growing period varies between 9 months with harvest before winter frost to 24 months in Hawaii, but it is generally 15 to 16 months. Plant (first) crop is normally followed by 2 to 4 ratoon crops, and in certain cases up to a maximum of 8 crops are taken, each taking about 1 year to mature. Growth of the stool is slow at first, gradually increasing until the maximum growth rate is reached after which growth slows down as the cane begins to ripen and mature. The flowering of sugarcane is controlled by daylength, but it is also influenced by water and nitrogen supply. Flowering has a progressive deleterious effect on sucrose content. Normally, therefore, flowering is prevented or non-flowering varieties are used.

Sugarcane does not require a special type of soil. Best soils are those that are more than 1 m deep but deep rooting to a depth of up to 5 m is possible. The soil should preferably be well-aerated (after heavy rain the pore space filled with air greater then 10 to 12 percent) and have a total available water content of 15 percent or more. When there is a groundwater table it should be more than 1.5 to 2.0 m below the surface. The optimum soil pH is about 6.5 but sugarcane will grow in soils with pH in the range of 5 to 8.5

                Sugarcane has high nitrogen and potassium needs and relatively low phosphate requirements, or 100 to 200 kg/ha N, 20 to 90 kg/ha P and 125 to 160 kg/ha K for a yield of 100 ton/ha cane, but application rates are sometimes higher. At maturity, the nitrogen content of the soil must be as low as possible for a good sugar recovery, particularly where the ripening period is moist and warm.
                Water Requirements:
                Adequate available moisture throughout the growing period is important for obtaining maximum yields because vegetative growth including cane growth is directly proportional to the water transpired. Depending on climate, water requirements (ETm) of sugarcane are 1500 to 2500 mm evenly distributed over the growing season.

                Yield:
                Sugar yield depends on cane tonnage, sugar content of the cane and on the cane quality. It is important that the cane is harvested at the most suitable moment when the economic optimum of recoverable sugar per area is reached. Cane tonnage at harvest can vary between 50 and 150 ton/ha or more, which depends particularly or. the length of the total growing period and whether it is a plant or a ratoon crop. Cane yields produced under rainfed conditions can vary greatly. Good yields in the humid tropics of a totally rainfed crop can be in the range of 70 to 100 ton/ha cane, and in the dry tropics and subtropics with irrigation, 110 to 150 ton/ha cane. The water utilization efficiency for harvested yield (Ey) for cane containing about 80 percent moisture is 5 to 8 kg/m3 and for sucrose containing no moisture 0.6 to 1.0 kg/m3, both with the highest values for good ratoon crops in the subtropics.
                Toward maturity, vegetative growth is reduced and sugar content of the cane increases greatly. Sugar content at harvest is usually between 10 and 12 percent of the cane fresh weight, but under experimental conditions 18 percent or more has been observed. Sugar content seems to decrease slightly with increased cane yields. Luxurious growth should be avoided during cane ripening which can be achieved by low temperature, low nitrogen level and restricted water supply. With respect to juice purity, this is positively affected by low minimum temperatures several weeks before harvest.
